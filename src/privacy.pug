                            | We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.
                h2 WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
                p We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
                p
                    strong If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
                    | The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
                    ul
                        li We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
                        li We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
                        li We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
                        li We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person. In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller" under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a "data processor" on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the "data controller" responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.
                    strong If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
                    | We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
                    ul
                        li If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
                        li For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
                        li For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
                        li If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
                        li For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
                        li If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
                        li If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
                        li If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
                        li If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
                        li If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
                        li If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations
                h2 WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
                p We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
                h2 HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
                p We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
                h2 HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
                p We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
                h2 DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
                p We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
