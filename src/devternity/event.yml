        # Agile Architecture

        Every system has an architecture, whether accidental or
        intentional, and regardless of whether it was put in place by a nominated
        architect or whether it emerged from the decisions and discussions of a team.

        All too often the focus of what is often described as architecture is centred
        around a specific set of platform technologies, which forms only one part
        of the set of concerns an architecture should. And all too often architecture
        is seen as a separate concern from development process, whereas the two are
        intertwined — **what you build is influenced by how you build it, and vice versa.**

        The course covers a wide range of topics through a number of practical exercises,
        with plenty of time dedicated to group discussion:
        * The relationship between development process and architecture
        * The roles and failure modes of testing, modelling and technology platforms
        * Different architectural styles and design patterns
        * How to transform product vision into architecture
        * Future-proofing your architecture, and accounting for uncertainty
        * How to ground your architecture and avoid overdesign

        And much more!

        # Domain-Driven Design in Theory and Practice

        Understand the concepts of DDD but feeling overwhelmed to implement? Feeling overwhelmed by complex examples and can't connect how to implement DDD in your project? Looking for more concrete guidance on the concepts and principles of DDD and want to learn how to connect it to real-world code? If this sounds familiar, then this masterclass is for you.

        We cover both the theory and patterns of DDD, and connect it to code with hands-on examples in .NET 6.

        In this masterclass, you'll learn:
        * What problems DDD addresses, when to use it, and when **not** to use it
        * The fundamental DDD building blocks — entities, value objects, domain services, etc.
        * How to integrate DDD into your software delivery
        * How to find and enforce service boundaries
        * How to define bounded contexts between microservices
        * How to craft and enforce a ubiquitous language
        * How to continuously refactor our model as our domain understanding evolves
        * How to pragmatically apply DDD in ASP.NET Core 6 and EF Core 6
        * ...and much more!

        We spend some time on the theory and concepts of DDD and then applying it to a real-world, complex example with hands-on code exercises.

        We will be using .NET as our development platform, but the learned concepts will be applicable to other languages and platforms.

        # Evolutionary Design: Beyond the Basics

        In this course, we discuss complex tradeoff decisions involved in making evolutionary design a core, everyday programming practice. You’ll learn how to start to make the design flex, how to balance production with protecting your production capacity, and how to expand your view from the elements of simple design to higher-level principles of modularity.

        Key topics:
        * How to crack the chicken-and-egg problem: I need to write tests in order to refactor, and I need to refactor in order to write tests.
        * How to understand when to refactor and when to rewrite, and how to do that safely.
        * How to break through your refactoring rut.
        * How to balanace customer tests (BDD) with programmer tests (TDD).

        # Coding Practices for Professional Developers

        Many of us are familiar with the challenges posed by legacy applications. Some have the luxury of starting with a clean slate, but over time, even greenfield projects can morph into something reminiscent of the legacy apps we once struggled with. These shared issues often lead both legacy and greenfield applications to a state where implementing even a minor change becomes a painful endeavor.

        How can we circumvent these challenges? What path should we tread? What are our goals? What defines an exemplary application? Let's collaboratively construct such an application during this masterclass!

        Join us for this masterclass where you will delve into practices that every professional developer should not only comprehend but also implement while building a Java-based business application. Throughout the course, you will:

          * Engage extensively in Test-Driven Development (TDD)
          * Craft tests using contemporary tools like Groovy and Spock
          * Master patterns and practices for writing tests that don't break when you refactor code internals
          * Construct robust business objects and rich domain models and understand the rationale behind it
          * Write business code that is configurable and detached from external systems such as DB or HTTP services
          * Develop a clear understanding of how to properly organize your code in packages and layers
          * ...and much more!

        This masterclass is dedicated to developers able to code and complete exercises in Java.

        Embark on this journey to refine your coding practices and emerge as a more adept professional developer!

        # Prioritizing Technical Debt in Large-Scale Systems

        Prioritizing technical debt is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams — no one has a holistic overview. Fortunately, a new set of techniques known as behavioral code analysis are here to help. These combine quality metrics with data on how the engineering organization works with the code. You can then prioritize improvements and risks so that you can balance short- and long-term goals guided by objective data. This new perspective on software development will change how you view code.

        Together we will:
        * Learn the principles of prioritizing technical debt
        * Prioritize technical debt in large-scale systems
        * Balance the trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features
        * Put quantitative numbers on the costs so that you can make the business case for larger improvements to non-technical stakeholders

        Go through real-world case studies from both Microservices and Monoliths.

        And much more!

        # Practical Messaging

        Increasingly developers are relying on distributed architectures to solve the problems of scaling their applications and their development teams. But that means they now have to consider the problem of getting the parts of their systems to talk to each other.

        In this masterclass, we will look at distributed systems, such as microservices, and how we integrate them. We will understand why we would prefer messaging, the fundamentals and key concepts of messaging, and how to build an event-driven architecture.

        Topics covered include:
        * Why and when distribute?
        * How messaging, distributed, and event-driven architectures work?
        * Different integration styles
        * Basic Messaging Patterns (work queues, publish-subscribe, dead letter channel...)
        * Advanced Messaging Patterns (streams, ordering, guaranteed delivery...)
        * Orchestration vs. Choreography
        * CAP Theorem
        * and much more!

        We will use Rabbit MQ message broker. Hands-on exercises are offered in C#, JavaScript, Python and Go.

        # Incremental Architecture

        You can’t simultaneously fight your code and be Agile—it slows you down too much. Your code’s design must evolve incrementally along with your understanding of the product. In this masterclass, you’ll learn **everything you need to create highly adaptable designs**. Along the way, you’ll also experience Event Storming and other Domain-Driven Design techniques.

        You’ll learn:
        * How to design a system that can evolve incrementally
        * SOLDIER principles (Simple, Obvious, Lightweight, Domain focused, Independent, Essential, Refactorable)
        * Architectural patterns appropriate for incremental development
        * How to create strictly-isolated highly decoupled subsystems
        * Domain-focused architectures (including DDD)
        * How to use the domain to maintain system coherence as the architecture grows
        * How to identify key abstractions, bounded contexts, entities, aggregates.

        In all, you’ll learn how to build a coherent and highly maintainable system and architecture that can easily accommodate changing requirements and grow incrementally as the system evolves

        # Pragmatic Refactoring Towards Better Architecture

        Are you struggling with your codebase which causes problems
        like poor maintenance, unreadability, performance, and poor testability? After this masterclass, you will be ready to identify and repair architectural
        and code root causes of those issues using proven patterns and techniques from Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development, Object-Oriented Programming, and modularization.

        During code exercises, we will walk through solutions
        to issues like:
        * What to do with a “God Classes”?
        * Modules/classes with huge coupling and with overload of business logic
        * Mismatch between the code model and the business model of the reality
        * How to repair data inconsistency?
        * Inefficient reads from my database?
        * No clear boundaries in my codebase, how to introduce some?
        * and much more!

        The masterclass will start with code that represents a huge legacy system that some of us have to work with on a daily basis. We will gradually refactor it and not only introduce patterns like CQRS, aggregates,
        policies, and parallel change, but also walk through how to talk about refactoring, technical debt, and how to sell our ideas to management.

        The course is for developers able to code and complete exercises in Java, C#, or PHP.

      # Scaling Yourself

      As information workers, we are asked to absorb even more information than ever before. More blogs, more documentation, more patterns, more layers of abstraction. Now Twitter and Facebook compete with Email and Texts for our attention, keeping us up-to-date on our friends dietary details and movie attendance second-by-second. Does all this information take a toll on your psyche or sharpen the saw? Is it a matter of finding the right tools and filters to capture what you need, or do you just need to unplug.

      # Lean Code

      Lean has been applied as a toolkit to fine-tune development processes and organisational workflow, but what does it mean when we apply the practices to the detail of the code, the practices used to develop it and the people who develop it? What does Lean Code and its creation look like? There is a need to move beyond often separated worlds of software craft and agile development, to properly embrace code in its detail, but to also connect it more completely to the flow of business and the intelligence of people around it. To move beyond simple exhortations of clean code to something more human. This talk offers a fresh look at Lean principles and practices from the perspective of the code and the coder, rather than the usual scale of the organisation and the development process.

      # Monolith Decomposition Patterns

      Big Bang rebuilds of systems are so 20th century. With our users expecting new functionality to be shipped more frequently than ever before, we no longer have the luxury of a complete system rebuild. In fact, a big bang migration of a monolithic architecture into a microservice architecture can be especially problematic, as we’ll explore in this talk.

      We want to ship features, but we also want to improve our architecture, and for many of us this means breaking down existing systems into microservices. But how do you do this while still regularly releasing new features?

      In this talk, I’ll share with you some key principles and a number of patterns which you can use to incrementally decompose an existing system into microservices. I’ll also cover off patterns that can work to migrate functionality out of systems you can’t change, which are useful when working with very old systems or vendor products. We'll look at the use of strangler patterns, change data capture, database decomposition and more.

      # All The Little Things

      In theory, object-oriented applications consist of small, interchangeable objects which know almost nothing about one another. In reality, many apps contain big classes full of long methods built of many conditionals. Our classes act more like procedures than objects; they know too much, they contain code we can't reuse, they're hard to change and they get worse every time we do so. This talk uses the principles of object-oriented design to break ugly procedures into pleasing objects which have just the right balance of knowledge and ignorance. It bridges the gap between theory and practice and reveals a few simple secrets of OOD that you can use to convert confusing, unmaintainable faux-OO code into understandable, reusable, easily testable objects.

      # Sabotaging a Transformation

      Transformations are difficult, and often simply fail. After all, change is usually disruptive. Even an organization that wants to embrace change can see mediocre results. The underlying causes vary from ignorance on how to transform, to full and hostile resistance. In this talk, we will discuss the various causes and the strategies we can use to overcome (or at least mitigate) this resistance to change, and create meaningful transformations with our clients.

      # The Most Dangerous Phrase

      Some advice is timeless; it ages like a fine wine. Each time you revisit it you discover a nuance, a new connection to something else. As you grow, the advice is waiting there to reveal another layer you had never considered.

      Some advice is a product of its time; it ages like milk. It starts fresh, then it begins to smell, and eventually it rots and can even become harmful! It made sense in the context and constraints of its day, but things have changed and it is no longer relevant.

      As Admiral Grace Hopper famously said: "The most dangerous phrase you can use is 'But we've always done it this way!'" Daniel believes this is why so many people have an almost religious zeal for SOLID, Scrum, and other antiquities.

      In this session, Daniel argues from first principles why ideas like SOLID and Scrum made sense in their day, over a quarter century ago, and why they have been superseded and should now be considered harmful. For contrast, he suggests Continuous Delivery and lean product development are ageing like fine wines. If there is time, he will show how methods like SAFe have never been relevant and never will be, but can be very appealing to a certain kind of manager.

      # Skills Commonly Missing from Many Senior Engineers

      Most have learned to communicate with compilers but not people, so they lack the skill to progress their ideas and solutions beyond the confines of a small team, code base, or the outside world. Code is going to continue to get easier to write, test, and deploy, and that's going to require the future of software development to change from spending most of your time in an IDE to in front of people. As the saying goes: "some people have ideas and some ideas have people", and it's going to require an additional set of skills to do that. Let'l talk about these skills.

      # The Economics of Software Design

      Every month, someone new asks me the question, "How do I convince my manager to let me refactor?" While it's true that a manager shouldn't constrain the programmer's plans to deliver high-quality code, the fact remains that some organisations allow their managers to assert this level of micro-control. In this talk I outline a set of models for justifying evolutionary design with basic economic concepts that relate directly to delivering, planning, and funding software projects. This talk will provide you with a solid argument to meet any skeptic's rational objections to writing tests first and letting both low-level design and architecture emerge.

      # The Architect Elevator: Redefining The Architect's Role

      Many large enterprises are feeling pressure: digital disruptors attack with brand-new business models and no legacy; the Facebook generation” has dramatically increased user expectations; and access to state-of-the-art technologies has been democratized by cloud providers. This is tough stuff for enterprises that have been, and still are, very successful, but are built around traditional technology and organizational structures. “Turning the tanker”, as the need to transform is often described, has become a board room-level topic in many traditional enterprises. Chief IT Architects and CTOs play a key role in such a digital transformation endeavor. They combine the technical, communication, and organizational skills to create business value from a tech stack refresh, to look behind buzzwords like “agile” and “DevOps”, and to build a technology platform that assures quality while moving faster. They do so by riding the “Architect Elevator” from the penthouse, where the business strategy is set, to the engine room, where the enabling technology is implemented. I rode that elevator for 5 years in a major financial services organization and am now advising major corporations on their digital journey. I collect stories from the daily life of IT transformation and package them in lighthearted, but meaningful anecdotes.

      # Code Red: The Business Impact of Code Quality

      Code quality is an abstract concept that fails to get traction at the business level. Consequently, software companies keep trading code quality for new features. The resulting technical debt is estimated to waste up to 42% of developers’ time, causing stress and uncertainty, as well as making our job less enjoyable than it should be. Without clear and quantifiable benefits, it’s hard to build a business case for code quality.

      In this talk, Adam takes on the challenge by tuning the code analysis microscope towards a business outcome. We do that by combining novel code quality metrics with analyses of how the engineering organization works with the code. We then take those metrics a step further by connecting them to values like time-to-market, customer satisfaction, and road-map risks. This makes it possible to a) prioritize the parts of your system that benefit the most from improvements, b) communicate quality trade-offs in terms of actual costs, and c) identify high-risk parts of the application so that we can focus our efforts on the areas that need them the most. All recommendations are supported by data and brand-new research on real-world codebases. This is a perspective on software development that will change how you view code. Promise.

      Looking at my LinkedIn Profile and seeing my current title as "Director of Engineering," you might feel that my career was an easy straight line from Dev to Director. You are wrong!

      I had many turns back and forth. In the 15 years of my career, I went from being The "Tech Support" guy to Programmer to Project Manager to QA, back to Engineering/DevOps and Agile Consulting, and finally to Engineering Management in the Mobile space, where I finally found myself in the last five years.

      In this talk, I will tell you how all the left and right turns I took on the road prepared me to be where I'm with a much more solid foundation than the 'straight-line career path approach" would ever do.

      If you've been in the tech industry for any length of time, you've probably been asked to participate in interviewing. Lucky folks will receive some basic training from their employer, but most are expected to just figure it out. It can be time-consuming, nerve-wracking, and tedious. You probably don't enjoy doing it, and that can lead to bad hires and painful experiences. Kris has participated in more than 250 interviews at AWS - as both an interviewer and a hiring manager - and has finally come to embrace the process. She'll provide practical tips you can use to conduct more effective interviews, saving you time and making the whole process a lot more enjoyable.

      # TDD Revisited: Where Did It All Go Wrong

      Since Kent Beck wrote the book on TDD in 2002 a lot of words have been dedicated to the subject. But many of them propagated misunderstandings of Kent's original rules so that TDD practice bears little resemblance to Kent's original ideas. Key misunderstandings around what do I test, what is a unit test, and what is the 'public interface' have led to test suites that are brittle, hard to read, and do not support easy refactoring. In this talk, we re-discover Kent's original proposition, discover where key misunderstandings occurred and look at a better approach to TDD that supports software development instead of impeding it. Be prepared from some sacred cows to be slaughtered and fewer but better tests to be written.

      # Vertical Slice Architecture

      Moving from a layered architecture to a vertical slice architecture can be a bit daunting. We remove abstractions, complex structures, and focus building on the axis of change, then what's next? What new structures, patterns, and policies will need to be introduced in this style of architecture? How will we deal with common business functionality, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in? In this session, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures, and dive into the patterns, tools, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems, from desktop, SPA, and normal MVC applications. Finally, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.

      # Solving JS Fatigue Using Fundamental Web Architecture and Htmx

      SPA architecture and the JSON API have allowed much more sophisticated web applications to be built and the approach has been formalized by libraries such as React and Vue. In the last few years, however, we have seen the rise of an associated phenomena: Javascript Fatigue in which developers admit to being overwhelmed by the complexity of the SPA architecture. Join this talk to learn how to compress the complexity of web development without losing all the benefits of SPA.
